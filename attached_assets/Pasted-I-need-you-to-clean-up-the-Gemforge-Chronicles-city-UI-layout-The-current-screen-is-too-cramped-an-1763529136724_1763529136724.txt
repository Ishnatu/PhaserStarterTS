I need you to clean up the Gemforge Chronicles city UI layout.
The current screen is too cramped and mis-scaled. Please adjust the HTML/CSS (and any React components if needed) with the following rules:

GENERAL LAYOUT

Increase spacing between elements so nothing feels squashed.

Use consistent vertical spacing between lines of text (line-height) and add padding inside panels.

The main top-left status panel should automatically expand to fit all its content (no text overlapping or clipping).

FONTS

Reduce the font size of the HP/SP labels and the “Gemforge Chronicles / ROBOAKA – City of Steel” text slightly so they don’t dominate the screen.

Use one consistent font size for labels (HP, SP, Evasion, DR, etc.) and a slightly larger size only for the main game title.

HP / SP BARS

HP and SP should not show “100/100” as text by default.

Instead, show only the bars.

On hover over each bar, show a tooltip (or small floating label) with the numeric values (e.g. “HP 100/100”, “SP 56/100”).

Make sure the bars stay the same pixel height and width, only the text behaviour changes.

RESOURCE ICONS (AA / CA etc.)

Slightly increase the icon size for the resource orbs so they’re more readable.

Add more horizontal spacing (margin or gap) between the icon and its number so the text isn’t touching the icon.

The AA and CA values should line up nicely under the HP/SP panel without overlapping other elements.

EVASION & DAMAGE REDUCTION ROW

Increase the icon size for Evasion and DR slightly.

Add a small horizontal gap between the icon and the label text (“Evasion:”, “DR: 14%”).

Ensure the icons and text sit on one clean line each with enough padding from the edges of the panel.

SHOPKEEP / NPC AVATARS (CENTER OF SCREEN)

Increase the avatar icon size slightly so they read better as interactive elements.

Add more vertical spacing between the NPC name text and the coloured column blocks so the text isn’t cramped.

Make sure each NPC avatar is centered over its block and has enough padding around it so it looks clickable.

STATUS PANEL BOX

The box that contains HP/SP, resources, evasion, DR, etc. should have:

padding inside the box so content doesn’t touch the edges

automatic height based on content (no fixed height that clips)

enough width so long labels don’t wrap awkwardly.

Please refactor the CSS to use flexbox or grid with sensible gap, margin, and padding values instead of hard-coding awkward pixel offsets.
After changes, nothing should overlap, text should be easy to read, and the layout should feel airy and deliberate.
