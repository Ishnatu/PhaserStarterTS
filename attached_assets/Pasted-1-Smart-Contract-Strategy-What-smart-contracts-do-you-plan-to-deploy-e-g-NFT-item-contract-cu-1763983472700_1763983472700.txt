1. Smart Contract Strategy
What smart contracts do you plan to deploy? (e.g., NFT item contract, currency token contracts, marketplace contract, forging/upgrade contract, loot box/RNG contract?)
In game items can be created as NFTs these will be weapons and armour as well as the voidtouched gems when we deploy those into the game.
What stays on-chain vs off-chain? Currently all game logic (combat, loot, progression, RNG) is server-side. What data/actions will move on-chain? NFTs and tokens
NFT Design: Will items/equipment become NFTs? If so, how does minting work - on demand, batch minting, or pre-minted pools? mint on demand
2. Wallet & Custody Model
Custodial or non-custodial wallets? Will players hold their own private keys, or will you manage wallets server-side (custodial)? players manage their own wallets through the ronin network
Gas fees: Who pays for on-chain transactions - players or you (meta-transactions)? players
Wallet linking: How do players connect wallets to game accounts? One wallet per account, or multiple? one wallet per account and connect through a contract with the ronin network
3. Marketplace & Trading
Marketplace design: Will you build a custom marketplace contract, or use an existing one (e.g., OpenSea)? the market place currently would be in game, the tokens however could be exported for trade.
Trading mechanics: Peer-to-peer trades, auction house, fixed-price listings? auction house in the market place section of the game
Royalties & fees: Do you take a cut on secondary sales? yes 7.5%
4. Tokenomics & Currency
Your two currencies (Arcane Ash & Crystalline Animus): Will these become ERC-20 tokens on-chain, or stay off-chain? they will be on-chain eventually, but on the ronin network. Not sure if that still makes them ERC20 tokens
Earning & spending loops: How do players earn tokens? Earn through playing the game, defeating delves, monsters and random events. How do they spend them? upgrading items and gear. Any bridge between on-chain and off-chain economies? yes - players will eventually be able to port their in game currencies out of the game to their wallet and sell them.
Token supply: Fixed cap, inflationary, deflationary? No fixed cap
Any staking or burning mechanics? burning mechanics is by the players upgrading their gear and the other aspects we've discussed in the white paper for the game.
5. Randomness & Oracles
RNG for loot/combat: Currently server-side deterministic. Will you move to on-chain RNG (Chainlink VRF, etc.)? No server-side is fine for now.
Oracles: Do you need external data feeds (price oracles, cross-chain bridges)? Please explain this to me, I don't know what that means.
6. Upgrade/Forging System
Forging on-chain or off-chain? Your +1 to +9 enhancement system with failure rates - will this happen via smart contract or stay server-controlled? it will stay server controlled for now. Players will be able to use the market place to put up weapons and armour that can be bought or sold with AA or CA 
Item destruction: If forging fails and items break, does that burn an NFT? yes
7. Admin Controls & Governance
Admin keys: Who controls contract upgrades, pausing, minting? Would I be the best person to do that? How does that work?
Multisig: Will you use multi-signature wallets for admin operations? How does that work? Is this the best process?
Upgradeability: Will contracts be upgradeable (proxy pattern) or immutable? How does this work?
8. Cross-Chain & Interoperability
Ronin-specific: Any plans to bridge to other chains (Ethereum mainnet, etc.)? Not at this stage
Katana DEX integration: Will players trade your tokens on Ronin's native DEX? yes
9. Current Off-Chain Security
Your current setup: Server-authoritative saves, Replit Auth, PostgreSQL, deterministic RNG. What parts of this infrastructure remain after Web3 integration? Is there anything in this you believe should be upgraded
API security: How will you authenticate on-chain actions with off-chain game state? Provided people aren't able to manipulate the data server side then the only need is for people to be buying or selling their earnt in game currency. So provided the amount they are looking to withdraw and sell is aligned with what is in the game that should be correct right?
