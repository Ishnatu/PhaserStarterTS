1. Smart Contract Strategy
What smart contracts do you plan to deploy? (e.g., NFT item contract, currency token contracts, marketplace contract, forging/upgrade contract, loot box/RNG contract?)
What stays on-chain vs off-chain? Currently all game logic (combat, loot, progression, RNG) is server-side. What data/actions will move on-chain?
NFT Design: Will items/equipment become NFTs? If so, how does minting work - on demand, batch minting, or pre-minted pools?
2. Wallet & Custody Model
Custodial or non-custodial wallets? Will players hold their own private keys, or will you manage wallets server-side (custodial)?
Gas fees: Who pays for on-chain transactions - players or you (meta-transactions)?
Wallet linking: How do players connect wallets to game accounts? One wallet per account, or multiple?
3. Marketplace & Trading
Marketplace design: Will you build a custom marketplace contract, or use an existing one (e.g., OpenSea)?
Trading mechanics: Peer-to-peer trades, auction house, fixed-price listings?
Royalties & fees: Do you take a cut on secondary sales?
4. Tokenomics & Currency
Your two currencies (Arcane Ash & Crystalline Animus): Will these become ERC-20 tokens on-chain, or stay off-chain?
Earning & spending loops: How do players earn tokens? How do they spend them? Any bridge between on-chain and off-chain economies?
Token supply: Fixed cap, inflationary, deflationary? Any staking or burning mechanics?
5. Randomness & Oracles
RNG for loot/combat: Currently server-side deterministic. Will you move to on-chain RNG (Chainlink VRF, etc.)?
Oracles: Do you need external data feeds (price oracles, cross-chain bridges)?
6. Upgrade/Forging System
Forging on-chain or off-chain? Your +1 to +9 enhancement system with failure rates - will this happen via smart contract or stay server-controlled?
Item destruction: If forging fails and items break, does that burn an NFT?
7. Admin Controls & Governance
Admin keys: Who controls contract upgrades, pausing, minting?
Multisig: Will you use multi-signature wallets for admin operations?
Upgradeability: Will contracts be upgradeable (proxy pattern) or immutable?
8. Cross-Chain & Interoperability
Ronin-specific: Any plans to bridge to other chains (Ethereum mainnet, etc.)?
Katana DEX integration: Will players trade your tokens on Ronin's native DEX?
9. Current Off-Chain Security
Your current setup: Server-authoritative saves, Replit Auth, PostgreSQL, deterministic RNG. What parts of this infrastructure remain after Web3 integration?
API security: How will you authenticate on-chain actions with off-chain game state?
