The header of the Blacksmith’s Forge panel is too congested. Elements are overlapping:

Title: Blacksmith's Forge

Currency icons + values

Mode toggles: [Enhance] [Repair All] [Repair]

I want these arranged in three clear rows, with consistent spacing and no overlap:

Row 1 – Title

Centered: Blacksmith's Forge

Row 2 – Currencies

Centered under the title

Layout: [AA icon] 210 [CA icon] 92.1

Add horizontal gap between the two currency blocks so they don’t touch

Row 3 – Tabs

Centered under the currencies

Text buttons: [Enhance] [Repair All] [Repair]

Each spaced out with a small horizontal gap, no overlapping, no wrapping

Please:

Wrap these three rows in a header container, e.g.:

<div class="forge-header">
  <div class="forge-title">Blacksmith's Forge</div>
  <div class="forge-currencies">
    <span class="currency">
      <img ...> 210
    </span>
    <span class="currency">
      <img ...> 92.1
    </span>
  </div>
  <div class="forge-tabs">
    <span class="tab active">[Enhance]</span>
    <span class="tab">[Repair All]</span>
    <span class="tab">[Repair]</span>
  </div>
</div>


Use flexbox to space these rows and items cleanly, for example:

.forge-header {
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: column;
  align-items: center;
  gap: 6px;              /* vertical spacing between title, currencies, tabs */
  margin-bottom: 12px;   /* space before the item list */
}

.forge-currencies {
  display: flex;
  align-items: center;
  gap: 16px;             /* space between AA and CA blocks */
}

.currency img {
  margin-right: 4px;     /* space between icon and number */
}

.forge-tabs {
  display: flex;
  gap: 12px;             /* space between [Enhance], [Repair All], [Repair] */
}


Remove any absolute positioning or negative margins currently used in this header. All spacing should come from gap, margin and padding, not overlapping elements.

The goal:

Title on its own line

Currencies on their own line, centered, not touching

Tabs on their own line, spaced out

No overlapping text or icons, everything readable at a glance.
